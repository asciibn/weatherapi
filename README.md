This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.2.

## Development server

## Build

## Running unit tests

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Things I would like to add
Google has an API that will alow users to have an Autocomplete feature. This would be useful for entering location. [https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/autocomplete)
I had removed the google maps feature. However with a good design it could be added and work with responsive features.
You can see how to add Google Maps to an Angular 2+ project [here](https://angular-maps.com/guides/getting-started/).
